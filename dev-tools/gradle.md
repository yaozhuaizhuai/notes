## 1.wrapper
The Wrapper is a script that invokes a declared version of Gradle, downloading it beforehand if necessary.

**benefits:**
* Standardizes a project on a given Gradle version, leading to more reliable and robust builds.
* Provisioning a new Gradle version to different users and execution environment is as simple as changing the Wrapper definition.
